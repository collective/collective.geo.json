Add GeoJson_ views for geoannotated contents, folders and collections

Some web mapping clients like Leaflet_ or Polymaps_ only accept json as
an input format. This product produces it.

It does not have any user interface, it just provides a GeoJson_ view
for contentitems, folders and collections. To test just append
`/@@geo-json.json` to the url.
